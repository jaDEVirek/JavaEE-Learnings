 *  Monotonic Array [896]  LeetCode problem
 *
 *  An array is monotonic if it is monotone increasing, or monotone decreasing. Since a <= b and b <= c implies a <= c,
 *  we only need to check adjacent elements to determine if the array is monotone increasing (or decreasing, respectively).
 *  We can check each of these properties in one pass.
